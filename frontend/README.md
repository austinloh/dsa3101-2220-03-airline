## **README for frontend**
This directory contains the subfolders such as assets, data and pages needed for the frontend web application main.py, along with other subfolders for organising this directory. The Dockerfile and requirements.txt required for the frontend container to be set up using `docker compose up` in the [main directory](https://github.com/austinloh/dsa3101-2220-03-airline "03 Airline Repository") can also be found here.

Minutes for both frontend and backend combined meetings can also be located in the minutes folder.
